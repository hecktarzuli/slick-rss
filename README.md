## Welcome to Slick RSS
### The news reader extension for Google Chrome.

#### As of 2014 Slick is no longer under active development.  Why?

1) There are plenty of other kick ass news readers out there, many with more features that are cross device capable.

2) I built Slick because I thought Chrome should have come with an RSS reader.  My goal was to make everything within the browser.  Slick did just that, but now I'm seeing how that was short-sighted.  We live in an always-connected world, so there isn't a strong reason an RSS reader can't be a web site.

3) If I'm going to spend a bunch of time building the next generation of RSS readers, why would I limit myself to just Google Chrome?  Chrome mobile doesn't even support extensions and Chrome is only the #3 browser worldwide.

4) RSS is a dieing technology.  This may be a little "out there", but if you ask me, RSS is showing some age.  Now days, people get their data from a wide variety of sources.  RSS, Facebook, Tweets, Pins etc..  RSS seems to be the old way of sharing data.


###### I'm including the source to V2 of Slick.  Keep in mind, this was my very first Google Chrome Extension, and the code is a bit sloppy.  I started it before I got into jQuery, so.. Have fun :)
